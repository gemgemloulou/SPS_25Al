# SPS_25Al

**** analysis.c ****
A code based on MakeClass, it plots histograms from trees, so it loops over multiplicities, etc. It also reads in cut files for each degrader setting (if you comment out the others). 
To run in root:
.L analysis.c++; analysis t; t.Loop()

**** analysis_plots.c ****
Draws everything from analysis.c. Also loads the cut files so you can see what cuts have actually been applied... Writes out lots of histograms. 

**** plotter.c ****
 Plots some SPS histograms, to check differences between beam on and beam off runs, for each degrader setting. This is for the default histograms that come out of the original sortcode. Gated things might be wonky                    

 Run on histogram files that have been hadded together, or individual runs. Execute using ROOT, using root -q plotter.c

**** plotter_too.c ****
A bit like plotter.c, but this one plots the same (data) histograms for each of the degrader settings, for a direct comparison
Again, run on hadded histogram files within ROOT. 

**** runbyrun.c ****
A code to compare one histogram run by run, to look for shifts

**** stripmaker.c ****
Silly script to project the 2D energy vs ring/wedge into separate histograms, in order to check the calibration. 
The input and output files are hardcoded in for now. 

Run on unpacked data, using root -q stripmaker.c

**** sort_al25_offline.cxx ****
This is a copy of the other versions of this code, but without the trees. I found that my version with trees
had a lot of memory leak issues, so I'm reverting back to the old "version 7", but now copied to this directory
for better version control. It needs to run with hupsort, and I don't think I can or should change that. 

Run on raw data, using:
ssetep hupsort-1.x
hupsort -f sort_al25_offline.cxx path/to/Run000xx

**** sort_al25_offline_v8.cxx ****
This is the latest version of the sort code with trees, and it seems to be working fine (26ix2019).
